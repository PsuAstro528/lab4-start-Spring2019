        "# Astro 528, Lab 4, Exercise 1\n\n## Optimization problems & Optimizing Code:  Type Stability & Profiling\n\nA common problem is to find the optimum (i.e., either minimum or maximum) value of a function.  While this can be straightforward for some well-behaved problems, for others it is extremely challenging.  There are numerous algorithms depending on the details of the properties of the function to be optimized (e.g., continuous vs discrete, number of dimensions), the availability of additional information (e.g., gradients) or constraints.  This exercise will introduce you to a few of the common optimization packages available in Julia.  In the process, you'll get some experience learn about profiling and optimizing a serial function.  \n\nBe aware that the field of optimization is extremely rich and there are numerous algorithms, libraries and packages, most specializing in some more specific class of optimization problems.  For a list of Julia packages for optimization, see [JuliaOpt's packages page](http://www.juliaopt.org/packages/) and the [JuliaNLSolvers organization](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers)."

        "## Fitting a model to data\n\nA common task in Astronomy & Astrophysics is to fit a model to data, varying the model parameters to find the \"best-fit\" values.  This is a form of optimization problem.  Often one maximizes goodness-of-fit criterion such as the log-likelihood (or minimize a loss function, such as $\\chi^2$).  In this exercise, we'll consider a very simple model, create a simulated dataset and (attempt to) find the best-fit model parameters. \n\nFirst, you'll follow along with the demonstrations trying to anticipate what will happen and comparing your expectations to reality.  \n\n## Linear optimization\n\nConsider the case of using linear regression to find the coefficients of a polynomial model, $y(x) = a_0 + a_1 \\times x + a_2 \\times x^2$.  For example, $x$ might be the column of a detector and $y$ might be the wavelength of light being accumulated at that column.  A simple implementation is provided in `wavelength_model(x,a)`.  Note that it takes an optional parameter `center`, which could be beneficial for reducing correlations between coefficients of different terms."

        "Second, wow, that was fast!  \nThat speed was possible because this problem is a form of linear optimization.  Here _linear_ refers to the predictions of the model being linear function of the coefficients for a fixed value of x (and not that the model is linear in x).  For linear optimization (without constraints), there is a single global best-fit solution and it can be found quickly using linear algebra.  \n\nNote the time required and the amount of memory allocated for a given $N_{obs}$.  \n\n### Least Squares Regression via Levenberg-Marquardt\nOften the predictions of physical models are non-linear functions of the model parameters.  In these cases, we'll need to move from linear optimization to _non-linear optimization_.  This can be much more challenging and computationally intensive.  First, it's not obvious that there will be one global optimum.  If there are just one or two parameters, then it may be practical to perform a thorough exploration of parameter space to look for each local optimum.  However, this often becomes impractical in higher dimensions.  Therefore, we often settle for using _local optimization_ algorithms whose result depends on the initialization.  If we have a good idea of where the optimum is likely to be, then we might provide an initial guess.  Otherwise, we might try running a local optimization algorithm several times using different initial guesses to increase the chances that we find the global optimum.  \n  \nFitting a non-linear model to data is such a common operation that there's a package, [LsqFit.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/LsqFit.jl), for this sort of problem.  LsqFit.jl uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algoritihm to try to find the values of the model parameters that minimize the $\\chi^2 = \\sum_i^{N_{obs}} \\left| \\frac{y_i - y(x_i)}{\\sigma_i} \\right|^2$.  \n\nFor pedagogical purposes, we'll continue using the same linear model as above, even as we try some algorithms capable of working with non-linear models.  In this example, we'll assume that a good initial guess is available."

However, it's always good to check if there could be some inefficiency in your code.  \n\nPerhaps the easiest way to write Julia code that's not as efficient as it could be is by writing code that is not _type stable_.  That is, the compiler can't be certain what type the variables will have at runtime, thus preventing it from compiling efficient code.  Look at `wavelength_model_centered_v1`.  Do you see anything that could prevent this function from being type stable?\n\nINSERT RESPONSE\n\nOften, it's hard to spot type instability by eye.  Fortunately, there are a few tools to help us identify when this happens.  For example, there's the `@code_warntype` macro. It shows you what Julia can deduce about the type of every line of your code.  For starters, let's try our simplest function, `wavelength_model`."

We could change the function to take x_center as an optional parameter (like `wavelength_model`).  We could create a composite type that contains both the polynomial coefficients and `x_center` with a fixed (or parameterized) type.  For simplicity, I'll suggest simply creating a local variable equal to `x_center`, but providing a _type annotation_ that makes a promise to the compiler that the type of x_center will always be a `Float64`.

What function is taking the most time?\n\nINSERT RESPONCE\n\nWithin that function, what is taking most of the time?  \n\nINSERT RESPONCE\n\nThe good news is that most of the time is doing some real calculations.  However, if we inspect the third-from top row, then we may be in for a suprise.  In this case, most of its time is being spent inside a function with `finite_difference` in its name.  Whether we realized it or not, the `curve_fit` function was using finite differences to estimate derivatives of the model predictions.  Realizing that's where it's spending most of our time, we can recognize that we might help the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to calculate derivatives more efficiently (and more accurately) by providing a Jacobian matrix.  That is, we'll give it a function that can calculate how the derivative of each prediction depends on the independent variable and model parameters.  Let's try that."

Perhaps, we're including penalty or regularlization terms or trying to find the mode of a posterior probability density.  Or maybe we just want to test whether a different algorithm might be better suited to our problem.  \nFor example, we could use the more flexible [Optim.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl) package that has multiple optimization algorithms that are able to optimize continuous functions that are more general than just $\\chi^2$.  Therefore, we must explicitly specify what function we would like it to minimize.  Below, we'll just compute $\\chi^2$, so we can make fair comparisons.
